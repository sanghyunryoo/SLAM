# Scan Context Module

- Scan Context is a global descriptor for LiDAR point cloud, which is proposed in this paper and details are easily summarized in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_etNafgQXoY"> video </a>.
- Scan Context is a global descriptor for LiDAR point cloud, which is especially designed for a sparse and noisy point cloud acquired in outdoor environment.
- A user can vary the resolution of a Scan Context. Below is the example of Scan Contexts' various resolutions for the same point cloud.
